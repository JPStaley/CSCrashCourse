# CSCrashCourse
If you're from the general public, you won't find anything useful here. this is where I'm going to stick files my girlfriend can use for a little CS Crash Course I'm giving her. It will eventually hold multiple .wiki's to help her keep track of infromation, and her code and my example code

For Gill:

This is our little space for files! here you can upload your finished code, and I can download it and make corrections and comments. I'll make a .wiki for you to use as well, which you will fill in. I'll also upload what I want to cover each week in a lesson plan wiki file
